Issues - one directionness is not preserved via 
osmnx network_type = 'walk' graph generation




if we use network_type = 'bike' - goes up on McTavish through very steep paths up to the main road up the mountain. That is the shortest. Not the best one, clearly

We are conservative in our approach (more bikers on the road (they take different writes))

Pattern recognition:
	
	Clustering
	Clustering + Gaussian distribution --> Gaussian mixture models
	Gaussianized heatmap * where people bike -> recover streets

	Visualize random selection of personal Bixi maps
